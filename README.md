# E4E Hardware Group
The E4E Hardware Group provides flexible hardware development to all E4E projects.  This can range from developing small camera laser mounts to large calibration targets to low power embedded systems.

# Design Lifecycle
## Design Requirements and Scope
The requirements of any task/design effort originate from a project. These must define the functional requirements of the hardware system.  These requirements must be reviewed and accepted by the Hardware Group Manager.

Design scope should not involve more than 1 quarter of effort from a 3 student team (300 person-hours).  Designs that require more than this must be broken up into 1 quarter phases and/or parallel design efforts.

## Design Tasking
The Hardware Group Manager should assign the tasking to a group of no more than 3 students with sufficient skills to take on this task.  If there are no students with the appropriate background skills, then this task may be assigned to students who have interest and sufficient background to learn the appropriate skills, with the expectation that the students will make efforts to learn the relevant skills.

# Procedures
Documentation should live in one of the following locations:
- E4E HW GitHub Wiki
- E4E GitHub Repo (per design)
- E4E NAS (in project share)

This should be determined per project.
