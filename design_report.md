# Design Reports
Design efforts should each have an associated technical report.  These efforts can broadly be sorted into the following categories:
1. New Design
2. Feature Modification to Existing Design
3. Defect Resolution on Existing Design

At the end of each of these efforts, the team SHOULD create a technical report detailing the engineering effort and design decisions associated with the changes.

Such technical reports MUST be made using one of the following tools:
1. LaTeX (and saved to a GitHub repo)
3. GHF Markdown (and saved to a GitHub repo as a Markdown file)
4. GHF Markdown (and saved to a GitHub wiki as a Markdown file)
5. Microsoft Word (and saved to the E4E NAS with associated design files)

All reports MUST include the following:
1. Design Requirements
2. Proposed Changes/Design
3. Test/Evaluation Methods
4. Test/Evaluation Results
5. Impact for Project
6. Links to associated and versioned design files
